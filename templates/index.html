        Since the dawn of the IPL in 2008, it has attracted viewers all around the globe. 
        A high level of uncertainty and last moment nail biters has urged fans to watch the matches. 
        Within a short period, IPL has become the highest revenue-generating league of cricket. 
        In a cricket match, we often see the scoreline showing the probability of the team winning based 
        on the current match situation. This prediction is usually done with the help of Data Analytics.
        Before when there were no advancements in machine learning, the prediction was usually based on 
        intuitions or some basic algorithms. The above picture clearly tells you how bad is taking run rate
        as a single factor to predict the final score in a limited-overs cricket match.
